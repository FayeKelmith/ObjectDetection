# ObjectDetection
An object detection model using  Detection Transformer model DETR trained on the Coco 2017 dataset. 

This project was meant to load videos and evaluate them on the DETR model released by facebook but failed. Works with incredible efficiency though with images.
Streamlit has been used to host this on an interface through which a picture can either be updated or taken on the spot.

TODO:
1. Deploy on streamlit cloud.
2. Accomplish same task using YOLOv8
